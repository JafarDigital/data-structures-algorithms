# Data Structures & Algorithms ‚Äì Personal Practice Repository

This repository documents my learning journey in learning essential **data structures and algorithms** as a foundational skillset for backend development, system design, automation, and technical problem solving.

---

## ‚úÖ Topics Covered / Planned

- **Basic Python Data Structures:** Lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, arrays, matrices + operations with them

- **Linked Structures:** Singly and doubly linked lists, stack and queue implementations, and comparisons with array-based structures.

- **Hash Tables:** Hash function design, collision resolution techniques, building a custom hash map, and performance insights into Python dictionaries and sets.

- **Binary Trees:** Implementation of binary trees and binary search trees (BSTs), tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and solving common tree-based problems.

- **Heaps and Priority Queues:** Min/max heap implementations, priority queue logic, heap sort.

- **Sorting Algorithms:** Basic sorting techniques (bubble, insertion, selection), advanced sorting (merge, quick), linear-time algorithms (counting, radix), and performance comparison.

- **Searching Algorithms:** Linear and binary search, search techniques on trees and graphs, and their use in real-world contexts like data filtering and pathfinding.

- **Recursion and Dynamic Programming:** Recursive thinking patterns, memoization, tabulation, and classic dynamic programming problems (e.g. knapsack, longest common subsequence).

- **Graphs:** Graph representations (adjacency list/matrix), BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra), and minimum spanning trees (Kruskal, Prim).

- **Advanced Algorithms:** Greedy strategies, union-find (disjoint sets), string matching algorithms, and selected specialized topics depending on interest and relevance.
